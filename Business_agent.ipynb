      "\n",
      "2. **University Student-Teacher Matching**: Similar to the service above but targeted for university students. The cost and revenue model is the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Educational Program Advertisement**: We provide a platform for advertising workshops, bootcamps, and educational programs. We charge a 10% commission from program providers for each registered attendee.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Language Teaching Services**: We offer language teaching in English, Arabic, German, French, and Spanish. This service is flexible and caters to all levels and age groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **International University Applications**: We assist students with their application process for international universities. We charge flat fees for this service, and payment is only required upon acceptance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our unique value proposition is our flexibility in service delivery and our pay-only-when-you-get-paid model. We're a community-driven agency with a mission to democratize access to quality education. Do any of these services interest you?\n"
